<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Universal Control</strong> is a 2.5D puzzle mobile video game where players take control of a gigantic hand to protect the planet Earth from an enormous meteorite rapidly approaching. Players need to successfully throw the meteorite into a black hole to complete the puzzle and progress to the next one. However, the meteorite will find on its way different sorts of obstacles such as planets or stars with their own gravity fields which players need to take into account beforehand when aiming for the black hole.</p>

To accomplish this, a simplified version of Unity's RigidBody's physics was implemented using <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verlet_integration">Verlet integration</a>.</p>
