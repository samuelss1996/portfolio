<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In 2017, between February 23rd and March 9th, I organized and taught a <strong>JavaFX course</strong> at my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usc.gal/etse/">Bachelor's faculty</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The course was completely free and aimed at any other students on the faculty who were interested on learning about JavaFX. My motivation was that I believed my Bachelor's programme did not put enough emphasis on teaching students about GUI programming.</p>

<p>The main objective of the course was to teach students to develop a very basic JavaFX application, thus providing them with a starting point from which to start to learn how to use that technology.</p>
