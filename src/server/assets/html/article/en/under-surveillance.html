<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Under Surveillance</strong> is the game <a href="https://adriannavarroperez.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Adrián Navarro Pérez</a> and I developed for our Master's Thesis.</p>
<p>In the game, the player takes control of a mysterious robot who can use electricity and water to solve a set of puzzles while unveiling the hidden enigma behind an uncharted dystopian world.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p><strong>Under Surveillance</strong> took approximately six months to develop (the time we had available for our thesis). The development time can be split in six different phases.</p>

<h3 id="phase-1-prototyping">Phase 1: Prototyping</h3>
<p>In this phase we focused on coming up with ideas and concretising the game we wanted to develop. We thought that a good starting point would be to write on paper our ideas in terms of mechanics, narrative, levels, etc.</p>
<p>These are some of the sketches we made.</p>

<h3 id="phase-2-designing-the-game">Phase 2: Designing the game</h3>
<p>As a part of our thesis we developed a specific game design methodology called the PEP framework. We used this methodology to design the game.</p>
<p>In this phase we essentially followed a formal process we had already created before to design the game mechanics, the environment and the interactions based on the ideas brainstormed in the first phase.</p>

<h3 id="phase-3-first-version-of-the-game">Phase 3: First version of the game</h3>
<p>In this phase we started to develop the game itself using <em>Unity</em>. As a the first version it was, our focus was primarily on creating a basic prototype of the game to test whether or not the ideas we had in our minds made sense and felt meaningful to play when implemented.</p>
<p>These is a screenshot of this version of the game.</p>

<p>Despite all the effort we put in this phase, we were self-critical enough to realise that the development was not going in the appropriate direction. We thought that this was mainly due to the level-design philosophy.</p>

<h3 id="phase-4-second-version-of-the-game">Phase 4: Second version of the game</h3>
<p>Since in the previous phase we thought that our level-design was the root cause of all the problems present in the game, we discarded the previous level and started a new one from scratch.</p>
<p>In particular, we focused on providing a more meaningful experience by turning Under Surveillance into puzzle-solving game instead of a simple point-and-click.</p>
<p>These are some screenshots of the game with this new level.</p>

</div>

<p>However, while this change brought some improvements to the game, we felt that there were some aspects that still were not clicking for us.</p>

<h3 id="phase-5-final-version-of-the-game">Phase 5: Final version of the game</h3>
<p>Finally, we realised that our main mistake was having a scope that was too broad.</p>
<p>From this point, we shifted our development philosophy radically into simplicity and minimalism. Simpler games are easier to polish in every sense. In this regard, we focused on creating a polished experience instead of adding complexity, both in terms of the graphics and the gameplay.</p>
<p>With this philosophy in mind, we managed to develop the final version of the game.</p>
<p>This is a gameplay of this version.</p>

<p>My main role during the development of Under Surveillance was <strong>gameplay programming</strong>. I was more on the technical side while Adrián focused mainly on game and level design.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have not published the repository of Under Surveillance. This is due to licesing issues with some assets we bought present in the source files.</p>
