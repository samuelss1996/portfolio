<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/838035/overview">Quantum Futures Hackathon 2019</a> was two-day immersive innovation experience at <a target="_blank" href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a>.</p>
<p>All the participants had the chance to attend exclusive talks, perform networking, and create multicultural and multidisciplinary teams in order to get to know each other while creating projects directly related to quantum technologies.</p>
<p>During the hackathon, my team and I developed <strong><a href="/projects/5fcbf9d911ff905a1c850322">Project: qbp</a></strong>, a 3D puzzle-solving video game.</p>
