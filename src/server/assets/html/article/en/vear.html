<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>VeaR</strong> is a short first-person horror Virtual Reality (VR) demo experience developed in Unreal Engine 4 where players fight mentally against their own paranoia through a TV that is broadcasting themselves trapped in a square-shaped room. Furthermore, they can interact with the TV by changing its properties by using a panel of buttons located in front of them.</p>

<p>Both Adrián and I had pretty similar, interchangeable roles. We both collaborated on game design, level design and gameplay programming, though my contribution was more relevant in the latter.</p>
