<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Blitter is an app that allows the user to scan a receipt using the camera and share the expenses among friends or family.</p>
<p>Using Blitter you will not have to do complex maths to know how much money each person has to pay when you go shopping or to a restaurant with your friends and family.</p>
<p>You just need to scan the receipt using your camera. Blitter will recognise the products and their prices. Then, you will be able to assign each product to one or more people. Finally, Blitter will calculate for you how much each person has to pay.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can share the breakdown with your friends using any app. </p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>The development of the app can be divided in four phases.</p>

<h3 id="phase-1-requirements-specification">Phase 1: Requirements specification</h3>
<p>A list of the functional requirements intended to be implemented on the app was tailored. The list of requirements can be found here:</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="phase-2-ui-prototyping">Phase 2: UI Prototyping</h3>
<p>A prototype of the user interface was done taking into account the requirements specified in the previous phase. The prototype was created using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adobe.com/es/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a></p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of this prototype.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="phase-3-software-design">Phase 3: Software design</h3>
<p>Having already defined the requirements of the app as well as how the user is going to interact with the product based on the UI prototype, it was time to design the overall architecture of the project. To accomplish this, <a target="_blank" href="https://staruml.io/">StarUML2</a> was used.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the diagrams.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="phase-4-implementation">Phase 4: Implementation</h3>
<p>Based on all the assets generated on the previous phases, the implementation phase was started.</p>
<p>The app was programmed for Android 4.1+ using Android Studio as the IDE and Kotlin as the programming language. The sources can be found in the GitHub repository:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="phase-5-publishing">Phase 5: Publishing</h3>
<p>Finally, when the app was fully developed it was time to publish it in the <em>Google Play Store</em>. It can be found here:</p>

</ul>
<p>The app was a relative success achieving more than 10,000 downloads and an average user rating of 4.5 out of 5.</p>
