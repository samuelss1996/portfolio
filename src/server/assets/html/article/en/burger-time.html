<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a re-implementation of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BurgerTime">BurgerTime</a>, a 1982 arcade game. The goal of this game is to complete a number of burgers while avoiding enemy foods.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>This project was developed as a part of one of my Master's courses: <em>Game Engine Architecture</em>.</p>
<p>The game was re-implemented using plain C++, with no third-party game engines. Instead, a basic game engine architecture was designed and implemented from scratch.</p>
<p>The only third-party library used was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php">SDL2</a>, that simply allows to easily draw sprites on the screen and play sound effects/music.</p>

<h2 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h2>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the game.</p>

<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not want to directly provide an executable of the game due to potential legal problems. Although the game is a copy of the original <em>BurgerTime</em>, no copyright infringement was intended. The game was developed purely for academical reasons.</p>
