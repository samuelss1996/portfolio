<p>Accordingly, I developed <strong>Project Daemon</strong>, a game in which the main character is a computer daemon that has to repair damaged sectors of the hard disk.</p>

<p>In the end, I was satisfied with the result. It was declared the <strong>local winner</strong> of the site from which I participated, with other 17 videogames being uploaded.</p>
