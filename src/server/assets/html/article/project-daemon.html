<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><strong>Project Daemon</strong> is the game I developed for the <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/project-daemon-7">Global Game Jam 2020</a>.</p>
<p>In Project Daemon the player controls a daemon of an operating system.</p>
<p>In computing, a daemon is process that runs in the background, managed by the operating system, performing tasks that the user does not necessarily see, but that are necessary for the correct functioning of the machine.</p>
<p>The daemon that the player controls, takes care of fixing damaged sectors of the hard disk, following the orders given by "Kernel", the character that rules the whole place. To fix these sectors, the player must reach the red boxes at the end of each level, turning these into green.</p>
<p>This is inspired by real-life hard disk analysis programs, which usually plot the hard disk sectors as a grid in which the correct sectors are marked with a green cell, and the incorrect ones with a red cell. From the gameplay perspective, Project Daemon is mostly a 2D platforming game, with some influences of rhythm-based games.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>The game was developed using <em>Unity</em>, during the 48 hours that the <a target="_blank" href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/project-daemon-7">Global Game Jam 2020</a> lasted for.</p>
