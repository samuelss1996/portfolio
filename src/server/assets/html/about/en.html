<p>I am <strong>Samuel Soutullo Sobral</strong>, a researcher in High-Performance Computing (HPC). From a young age, I was always drawn to the world of computers and programming. This led me to study a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and subsequently, a Master's in Game Design and Technology in Sweden.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have gained experience in various areas, such as <strong>video game development, mobile app development, and web app development</strong>. One of my most notable projects was <a class="router-link" href="/projects/5fcd2f7f11ff905a1c8512a1">Blitter</a>, an Android app with more than <strong>10,000 downloads</strong>. After working for two years as an Android developer, I discovered that my true calling was in academia, which led me to start a PhD in Information Technology Research at the University of Santiago de Compostela in October 2023.</p>

<p>I consider myself a person with a strong desire to learn and share knowledge. During my degree, I organized and taught a <a class="router-link" href="/activities/5fce853f8789b87fe66bbb3b">JavaFX course</a>, and now, I am even more committed to education and research. I see myself in the future working as a university professor and researcher, contributing to the advancement of our understanding of technology and its applications.</p>

<p>My journey has been recognized with several awards, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.gdg.es/2016/02/ganadores-del-concurso-de-apps-del.html">the best idea at Android Study Jams 2016</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usc.gal/etse/node/10575">award for one of the three best records in the Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering</a>, and one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://fundacionbarrie.org/resolucion-convocatoria-becas-posgrado-barrie-2018">10 postgraduate scholarships abroad from the Barri√© Foundation</a>.</p>
