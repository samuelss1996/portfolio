<p>I am <strong>Samuel Soutullo Sobral</strong>, an aspiring developer. Since I was young, I have always been passionate about the world of computers and programming. This was what led me to study a bachelor's in computer engineering and later a master's in game design and technology.</p>

<p>I consider myself a person who loves to learn new things. Thus, I have gained experience in various fields such <strong>video games, mobile applications and web applications development</strong>. You can check <a class="router-link" href="/projects">all my projects</a> in this portfolio. However, the most successful is <a class="router-link" href="/projects/5fcd2f7f11ff905a1c8512a1">Blitter</a>, an Android application with more than <strong>10,000 downloads</strong>.</p>

<p>However, I also love sharing my knowledge with others. This is why while I was studying the degree I organized and taught a <a class="router-link" href="/activities/5fce853f8789b87fe66bbb3b">course on JavaFX</a>, a technology to develop GUIs in Java.</p>

<p>My desire to do my best (along with a bit of luck) led me to obtain several recognitions such as the award for the <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.gdg.es/2016/02/ganadores-del-concurso-de-apps-del.html">best idea in Android Study Jams 2016</a>, and one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://fundacionbarrie.org/resolucion-convocatoria-becas-posgrado-barrie-2018">10 postgraduate scholarships from the Barri√© Foundation</a>.</p>
